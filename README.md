# PulseBeam Protocol Buffer Definitions

Protocol Buffer (.proto) definitions for client-server communication with PulseBeam servers via data channels. This is an optional dependency, it's only necessary to enhance
user experience beyond WHIP/WHEP standard. 

There's no extra proprietary protocol implemented or designed yet. The current effort goes to the PulseBeam server for now, https://github.com/PulseBeamDev/pulsebeam
