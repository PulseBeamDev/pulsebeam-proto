# PulseBeam Protocol Buffer Definitions

Protocol Buffer (.proto) definitions for client-server communication with PulseBeam servers, powering our real-time communication platform.

## Usage

These .proto definitions are most commonly used in the PulseBeam web client, which handles protobuf compilation and abstraction. For web applications, we recommend using our JavaScript Peer SDK:
* Package: [@pulsebeam/peer](https://jsr.io/@pulsebeam/peer)
* Source: [github.com/PulseBeamDev/pulsebeam-js](https://github.com/PulseBeamDev/pulsebeam-js).

If you are building clients or servers in other languages, or need a custom implementation, you can use these definitions directly or build platform-specific integrations. [Reach out](https://pulsebeam.dev/docs/community-and-support/support/) to our team we would love to hear what you're building and help however we can!
